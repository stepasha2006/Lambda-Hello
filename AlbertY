Hi my name is Albert Yakubov

I love to live my life to the edge, always taking risks, and taking on the new adventures

I never so much had to enjoy the finish line as much as I enjoy the path it self. I always believed that once you stop learnig 
you do stop growing

I do not take any risks, trying to play it safe and stay home

I am very conceded and like to be praised for bad results!
